# Frank Pilot — Fix Plan & Task Backlog

## Status Key
- ✅ DONE
- 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- ⬜ TODO

---

## Loop 1 — Test Infrastructure + Utility Coverage

### ✅ Set up Jest + ts-jest configuration — `jest.config.js` created
### ✅ Write tests: `src/utils/encryption.ts` — 16 tests (round-trip, tamper detection, masking)
### ✅ Write tests: `src/utils/pii-filter.ts` — 18 tests (SSN, card, email, phone, JSON keys, object sanitization)
### ✅ Write tests: `src/middleware/rbac.ts` — 24 tests (separation of duties, role hierarchy, permission matrix invariants)

**Result:** 58 tests, all passing.

---

## Loop 2 — Screening Module Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/screening/compliance.ts` — 13 tests
- Mock `query` from `../../config/database`
- Test: property not found → review_required
- Test: AMI limit found → pass when income within limits
- Test: AMI limit found → fail when income exceeds limits
- Test: asset threshold logic (>$5000 → review_required)
- Test: falls back to prior year AMI when current year missing
- Note: use `toContainEqual(expect.stringMatching(...))` for array element regex checks

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/screening/fraud-detection.ts` — 14 tests
- Mock `query` from `../../config/database`
- Test: checkDuplicateSSN — duplicate found
- Test: checkDuplicateSSN — no duplicate
- Test: checkIncomeMismatch — <15% discrepancy → no flag
- Test: checkIncomeMismatch — 15-30% discrepancy → medium severity
- Test: checkIncomeMismatch — >30% discrepancy → high severity
- Test: checkApprovalSpeed — < 5 min → flags anomaly
- Test: checkApprovalSpeed — >= 5 min → no flag

**Result:** 27 tests, all passing (85 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 3 — Approval Service Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/approval/service.ts` — 41 tests
- Mock `query`, `writeAuditLog`, `enforceSeparationOfDuties`, `FraudDetectionService`
- Test: tier1Review — wrong status → throws
- Test: tier1Review — separation of duties violation → throws
- Test: tier1Review — unresolved fraud flags + pass decision → throws
- Test: tier1Review — pass + high rent → routes to tier2_review
- Test: tier1Review — deny → tier1_denied
- Test: requiresTier2 logic (rent >$1500, review_required checks) via test.each
- Test: requiresTier3 logic (exceptions only) via tier2Review
- Test: getNextAction returns correct string for each status via test.each
- **Gotcha:** Use `mockQuery.mockReset()` (not `clearAllMocks`) in beforeEach for
  test.each suites — `clearAllMocks` does NOT flush `mockResolvedValueOnce` queues,
  causing queue items to leak across iterations.

**Result:** 41 tests, all passing (126 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 4 — Application Module Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/application/validation.ts` — 45 tests
- Test: minimal + full valid payloads pass
- Test: each required field missing → fails (propertyId, firstName, lastName, ssn, dateOfBirth)
- Test: propertyId must be UUID
- Test: SSN — dashes optional (123456789 valid), spaces/wrong-grouping/letters → fail
- Test: dateOfBirth — YYYY-MM-DD only; MM/DD/YYYY and freeform rejected
- Test: annualIncome — 0 accepted (LIHTC zero-income households), negative fails
- Test: requestedLeaseTermMonths — 1–60 inclusive, non-integer rejects
- Test: currentState — exactly 2 chars
- Test: previousRentalDurationMonths — 0 accepted (first-time renters), negative fails
- Test: submitApplicationSchema — UUID required
- Test: updateApplicationSchema — SSN omitted (immutable), all fields optional, validation still applies
- No mocks needed — pure Zod schema tests

**Result:** 45 tests, all passing (171 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 5 — Decision Matrix Tests

### ✅ Explore and test `src/modules/decision-matrix/service.ts` — 22 tests
- Test: unknown modification type → throws, no DB call
- Test: tenant_substitution → requiresRescreening: true in INSERT params
- Test: lease_term_change → asset_manager, pet_policy_change → senior_manager, other → senior_manager
- Test: rent_increase >10% → regional_manager; ≤10% (boundary 10%) → senior_manager
- Test: audit log written with correct action + requiresRescreening detail
- Test: decideModification — already decided → throws; insufficient role → throws
- Test: decideModification — approve/deny → correct status + audit log
- Test: listModifications — returns rows, queries by application_id, empty array
- **Bug documented:** `requestModification` mutates shared `MODIFICATION_RULES` object when
  rent_increase ≤10% (sets `rule.requiredRole = "senior_manager"`). Subsequent >10% tests in the
  same worker also get senior_manager. Tests ordered accordingly and bug captured in comments.

**Result:** 22 tests, all passing (193 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 6 — Bug Fix: Decision Matrix Mutation

### ✅ Fix mutation bug in `src/modules/decision-matrix/service.ts`
- **Bug:** `rule.requiredRole = "senior_manager"` mutated the shared `MODIFICATION_RULES`
  constant, causing all subsequent `rent_increase` requests (even >10%) to use
  `senior_manager` instead of `regional_manager` for the lifetime of the process.
- **Fix:** Introduced local `let requiredRole = rule.requiredRole` variable; the shared
  constant is never written to.
- Updated decision-matrix tests: removed ordering workarounds, converted the
  "documents the bug" test to a proper regression test asserting correct behaviour.
- All 193 tests still passing.

---

## Loop 7 — Screening Orchestration Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/screening/service.ts` — 22 tests
- Mock `query`, `writeAuditLog`, `decrypt`, `BackgroundCheckService`, `CreditCheckService`, `ComplianceService`
- Test: application not found/not submitted → throws
- Test: all pass → overallResult=pass, status=screening_passed
- Test: each individual check fail → overallResult=fail, status=screening_failed
- Test: review_required (no fail) → overallResult=review_required, status=screening_passed
- Test: fail takes precedence over review_required
- Test: SSN decrypted, only last 4 passed to check services (PCI-DSS)
- Test: DOB decrypted and passed through; falls back to "NV" when state missing
- Test: annualIncome parsed from string; defaults to 0 for null (LIHTC zero-income)
- Test: audit log written for screening_initiated, each check completion, and screening_completed
- Test: getResults returns null on miss, row on hit, queries by applicationId
- **Note:** TypeScript enforces full return-type shapes on mocked methods — use `as any`
  on mock helper return values when the full details object is not relevant to the test.

**Result:** 22 tests, all passing (215 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 8 — Payment Service Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/payment/service.ts` — 24 tests
- Mock `query`, `writeAuditLog`, `stripe` (virtual module mock for dynamic require)
- Test: createCustomer stub path (no key / placeholder key) — cus_stub_ ID, DB write, no audit log
- Test: createCustomer live path — stripe.customers.create called, DB write, audit log written
- Test: setupPaymentMethod — no stripe_customer_id → throws
- Test: setupPaymentMethod stub path — DB update, audit log, success:true returned
- Test: setupPaymentMethod live path — attach + setDefault called on Stripe
- Test: enrollAutoPay — no stripe_payment_method_id → throws
- Test: enrollAutoPay — DB update, audit log with monthlyDiscount:25, returns enrolled:true
- Test: getPaymentStatus — null on miss; effectiveRent = rent when no auto-pay;
  effectiveRent = rent-25 when enrolled; floor at $0; hasPaymentMethod/hasCustomer flags;
  null rent defaults to 0
- **Note:** Stripe is `require()`d dynamically in the constructor — mock with
  `jest.mock('stripe', factory, { virtual: true })` and control the path via
  `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` before `new PaymentService()`.

**Result:** 24 tests, all passing (239 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 9 — Application Route Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/application/routes.ts` — 24 tests
- Install: `supertest` + `@types/supertest` (not previously in project)
- Auth strategy: real JWT tokens via `generateToken` + mock the users DB query
  that `authenticate` runs — exercises actual auth middleware, not a stub
- Service strategy: mock `ApplicationService` at module level (instantiated at route scope)
- Test: 401 with no token, malformed Bearer, wrong-secret token
- Test: 400 on Zod validation errors (missing fields, invalid SSN, non-UUID propertyId)
- Test: 400 on negative annualIncome in PATCH
- Test: 201 POST / happy path; service.create receives user ID + role
- Test: 500 when service.create throws
- Test: GET / — 200, query params forwarded to service.list
- Test: GET /:id — 404 when service returns null, 200 when found
- Test: PATCH /:id — 400 on validation, 200 on valid partial update
- Test: POST /:id/submit — 200 happy path, 400 on service error, correct args

**Result:** 24 tests, all passing (263 total across all loops).

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/approval/routes.ts` — 32 tests
- Mock `ApprovalService` at module level (instantiated at route scope)
- Auth strategy: real JWT tokens + mock users DB query for `authenticate`
- Test: 401 with no token / invalid token across all four endpoints
- Test: tier RBAC enforcement — leasing_agent blocked from tier1/tier2/tier3
- Test: senior_manager blocked from tier2/tier3 (approval:tier2 requires regional_manager+)
- Test: regional_manager blocked from tier3 (approval:tier3 requires asset_manager+)
- Test: Zod validation — missing decision, missing notes, empty notes, invalid enum value
- Test: 200 happy path for senior_manager on tier1, regional_manager on tier2, asset_manager on tier3
- Test: correct args forwarded to tier1Review/tier2Review/tier3Review (applicationId, decision, notes, reviewerId, reviewerRole)
- Test: 400 when service throws (wrong status, separation of duties violations)
- Test: GET /:applicationId/status — accessible by all roles (application:read is universal)
- Test: getApprovalStatus receives correct applicationId; 400 on service error

**Result:** 32 tests, all passing (295 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 11 — Screening Route Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/screening/routes.ts` — 26 tests
- Mock `ScreeningService` and `FraudDetectionService` at module level

- Test: results — correct applicationId forwarded; 500 on unexpected throw
- Test: GET /:applicationId/fraud-flags — 401/403 enforced, empty array, populated array
- Test: fraud-flags — correct applicationId forwarded; 500 on throw
- Test: POST /fraud-flags/:flagId/resolve — 401/403/400 enforced (leasing_agent, senior_manager both blocked — fraud:resolve requires regional_manager+)
- Test: resolve — 400 when notes missing, 200 happy path, correct args (flagId, userId, notes) forwarded
- Test: resolve — 500 when fraudService.resolveFlag throws

**Result:** 26 tests, all passing (321 total across all loops).

---

## Loop 12 — Payment Route Tests

### ✅ Write tests: `src/modules/payment/routes.ts` — 25 tests
- Mock `PaymentService` at module level; also mock `stripe` as virtual module to prevent load errors
- Auth strategy: real JWT tokens + mock users DB query for `authenticate`

- Test: GET /:applicationId — leasing_agent allowed (payment:view is open to all roles)
- Test: getPaymentStatus — 404 on null, 200 with full status object, correct applicationId forwarded; 500 on throw

**Result:** 25 tests, all passing (346 total across all loops).
